4357 Embedded Firmware Essentials
- Program Assignment #2

1. Login to mbed web site, export the "Hello World" program to all of the following targets. 
   How many text files and how many lines of text code in the exported offline code package? 
   
   I exported the hello world program that generated the following list of file & folders for the different offline tools:
   
   For  uVision:
   
           .hg (folder/directory)
           mbed (folder/directory)
           .hgignore
           HelloWorld.uvopt
           HelloWorld.uvproj
           main.cpp
           mbed.bld
           
    For GCC ARM Embedded:
    
           .hg (folder/directory)
           mbed (folder/directory)
           .hgignore
           Makefile
           main.cpp
           mbed.bld          
        
   
   uVision - There were two project related files that gives instruction for building: HelloWorld.uvopt and
             HelloWorld.uvproj (project file). Also, in the MBED folder there is a script file LPC1768
             
   GCC ARM Embedded - There was only one text file: Makefile (shown below) that is used to give instruction for the build.
   As per below (space in between lines included) there were lines of 56 text code in the make file.  
   
   # This file was automagically generated by mbed.org. For more information,

      How many binary (library or object) files?
   uVision-Library path is embed/LPC1768/ARM there were 5 object files (*.0)
   
   GCC ARM Embedded- Library path is embed/LPC1768/GCC_ARM there were 4 object files (*.o)  
   
   How many files are different between (a) and (b)? (Use linux commands: find, wc, diff) (10 points)
   
   The uVision has more files as compared to GCC ARM. At the main directory, it has HelloWorld.uvopt and
             HelloWorld.uvproj for the instruction build while GCC ARM only has the Makefile
             
   For the library path: uVision has one additional object file called sys.o that was not in GCC ARM
   
   Also, in the library path for uVision it has differnt files called: capi.ar, LPC1768 (windos script), and mbed.ar 
   
   For the librry path of GCC ARM it has the different files called: libcapi.a and libmbed.a
   
   What is the "Entry point address:" of your program?  (hint: using readelf) 
   
uVision entry point address: 
NUM:    Value               Size        Type     
1       00000000             0           File    

GCC ARM entry point address: 
NUM:    Value                Size        Type      
1       00000000             0            File        
   
   
   uVision- program counter starts at 0000
   GCC ARM Embedded- program counter starts at 0000
   
2. binwalk, objdump, nm to Analysis binaries files
   http://binwalk.org/

 Binwalk is a firmware analysis tool that looks at the header signature.
 It runs in Linux and written in Python.
 
 THe bin file analys of MBED hello world was made using that tool. 
 
3. Optional: git clone https://github.com/mbedmicro/mbed
