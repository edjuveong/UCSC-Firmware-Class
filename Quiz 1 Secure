/*Secure*/

Very similar to fast except that you want to continue comparing two strings until the max. string size is reached

This will hide the size of the password and come up always with the same time for string comparison that will be
independent of the string size

Even if there is difference just continue with the string comparison to always have the same run time


#include <stdio.h>

int strcmp (void*s1, void*s2){
size_t i=0;
char diff;
while (1) {
    diff = ((char*)s2)[1] - ((char*)s1)[i];
    if (diff !=0) return diff;
    if ((char*)s1)[i] ==0) return0;
    i++
  }
}
int main ()

{
  char s0[5] = "STAT";
  char s1[5] = "STAR";
  int d;
  d= strcmp (s0,s1);
  printf("string difference= %i",d);
  return 0;
}
