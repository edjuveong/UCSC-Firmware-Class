The group members: Emel, Yat, and Edward
Project: Portable thermal data logger

The group decided to use the TMP102 temperature sensor due to its availablity with corresponding example program.
We are learning that this sensor uses I2C communication, which is becoming popular for the different sensors.

At the start of defining the hardware platform we learned that we need to add LDO regulator for the USB support
to convert the 6VDC from 4 X AA battery to 5VDC. 

We are using the 4 X AA battery as the main power source (this is connected to Vin of MBED) and converting to 5VDC for the USB port (using LDO)
and 3.3V for the thermal sensor (3.3V coming from MBED Vout)

I personally learned that to be able to use the uVision I need to update the firmare of my MBED board.

Good learning so far in the initial stage of the project.
