The group members: Emel, Yat, and Edward
Project: Portable thermal data logger

The group decided to use the TMP102 temperature sensor due to its availablity with corresponding example program.
We are learning that this sensor uses I2C communication, which is becoming popular for the different sensors.

At the start of defining the hardware platform we learned that we need to add LDO regulator for the USB support
to convert the 6VDC from 4 X AA battery to 5VDC. 

We are using the 4 X AA battery as the main power source (this is connected to Vin of MBED) and converting to 5VDC for the USB port (using LDO)
and 3.3V for the thermal sensor (3.3V coming from MBED Vout)

I personally learned that to be able to use the uVision I need to update the firmare of my MBED board.

Good learning so far in the initial stage of the project.

I encounterd some problem in updating the firmware of the MBED oard (need to be able to use the board with uvision 5.0).
THe bin file opens upp immediately when I am trying to upload this. Apparently, this is an issue with IE8/9.
I will need to right click at the selection and save the bin file with if extension to the MBED board. The board did update
the firmware after power cycling once the bin file was downloaded to the board.

We started to study some existing libraries of funtions that the group can use the read the TMP102 valu thriugh the I2C
communication and to open a csv file, upload the temperature readings, close the csv file as it gets saved into the USB drive.   

Nov. 09- THe project is working properly and project size is 31KB so we can still use u Vision

Nov. 10- We added LCD display to show the value of temperature being stored in USB drive and also changed the power source
from 4 X AA to 1 X 9VDC battery. We used the textLCD library and was able to make it to work. 

However, project size is now 33KB (exceeds 32KB) so no choice  but to use the online MBED compiler.

Project is properly working with LCD display (16 X 2) and will be used for the class demo.
