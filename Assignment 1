Homework #1

1.) Function in C lanaguage

/*Part 1 of Homework 1*/
#include <stdio.h>

/*Function to get the product of two integers*/
int multiply (int a, int b)
{
  int r;
  r=a*b;
  return r;
}

/* Main calling the function multiply */
int main ()
{
  int z;
  z = multiply (5,3);
  printf( "The product is %i",z);
return 0;
}



2.) Hardware discovery project: Parallax USB two channel Oscilloscope (2006 model)

Microcontroller:  Parallax SX48DB
                  8 bit RISC microcontroller
                  Harvard architecture
                  Clock Frequency up to 75Mhz
                  262 Bytes SRAM
                  4K words EEPROM (Flash) 
                  Operating voltage: 3.0VDC to 5.5VDC 
                    
The SX48DB mincroncontroler uses its I/O pins to communicate with the IC: FT32RL for the USB interface
The microcontroller also uses its I/O pins to read analog data from the ADC LTC2286
