4357 Embedded Firmware Essentials
Program Assignment #3 10 points
Read Chapter 1,2,3, and Chapter 14

I completed reading all the assigned chapters of our text book on Embedded systems, MBED, Digital Input & Output, 
and the MBED libraries + control registers.

Program Example 14.1 Manipulating control registers to flash an LED

I then tried the program of Example 14.1 by downloading this from this site:  http://embeddedacademic.com/
I then used both the online compiler and the uVision compiler to generate the program files and store this into the MBED board.
I attached LED at pin no. 26 together with a series 100ohms resitor to ground.

The pogram executes by turning on and off a single LED at a constant specified rate.

The program is able to configure the PINSEL nd FIODIR registers for the I/O pins. The pin 26 was configured as an output and
was set and reset by the program with a certain delay interval. The delay is a program function to loop for 1M times to generate
the time interval between the blinking of the LED.

Pls. check my Google drive per below link for the pictures of the program running on my MBED baord
