4357 Embedded Firmware Essentials
Program Assignment #3 10 points
Read Chapter 1,2,3, and Chapter 14

I completed reading all the assigned chapters of our text book on Embedded systems, MBED, Digital Input & Output, 
and the MBED libraries + control registers.

Program Example 14.1 Manipulating control registers to flash an LED

I then tried the program of Example 14.1 by downloading this from this site:  http://embeddedacademic.com/
I then used both the online compiler and the uVision compiler to generate the program files and store this into the MBED
board (either one can be used to load the compiled program file to the MBED board). I attached LED at DIP pin no. 26 (this is P2.0 of LPC1768) together with a series 100ohms resistor to ground.

The pogram executes by turning on and off a single LED at a constant specified rate.

The program is able to configure the PINSEL and FIODIR registers for the I/O pin P2.0 of LPC1768. The DIP pin 26 was configured
as an output and was set and reset by the program with a certain delay interval. The "delay" is a program function to loop
for multiple times to generate the time interval between the blinking of the LED.

Program Example 14.1 Manipulating control registers to flash an LEDProgram Example 14.3 Combined digital input and output.
Compile and download Program Example 14.1 and 14.3 into your mbed board.

Here are the I/O pins used for this program:

DIP Pin 26 (P2.0 of LPC1768) where the yellow LED is connected  
DIP Pin 25 (P2.1 of LPC1768) where the green LED is connected 
DIP Pin 9  (P0.0 of LPC1768) where the push button switch is connected with pull up resistor to Vout(3.3V)

Depending on the condition of switch (open/close) it applies a logic 1/logic 0 to the DIP pin 9. The program reads this
input and interchanges the turn on/off rate of each of the LEDs (one LED is turning on/off about twice than the other)  

The program is able to configure the PINSEL and FIODIR registers for the I/O pin P2.0, P2.1, and P0.0 of LPC1768. The DIP
pin 26 (2.0) and DIP pin 25 (P2.1) were configured as outputs and were set and reset by the program with a certain delay 
interval. The DIP pin 9 (P0.0) was configured as an input. The program reads the logic level of this DIP pin 9 and
interchanges the turn on/off of the two LEDS.  The "delay" is a program function to loop
for multiple times to generate the time interval between the blinking of the LEDs.
