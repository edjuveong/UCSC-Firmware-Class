4357 Embedded Firmware Essentials
Program Assignment #3 10 points

I completed reading chapter 7 on Serial Communications

I then studied the program 7.9 to understand what it is trying to do. I learned that it is using the serial communication
lines Tx (transmit) DIP pin 9 and Rx (receive) DIP pin 10 to send/receive data serially to and from the other mbed board.

It uses the mbed function library: async_port.putc(switch_word) to transmit data and the library function async_port.getc()
to receive data. 

The program cofigured pins 5 and 6 as input for the two switches and the pins 25 and 26 for output to drive the LEDs 

I then compiled and loaded the program Example 7.9 for the bidirectional data transfer into each of my two mbed LPC1768 boards
(both have  identical programs). 

I also exchanged notes on this with my classmate Yat Tam for the collaboraive learning.

I then connected the two mbed boards together as per Figure 7.13. 

The program worked perfectly the first try as I can control the LEDs from the mbed board by turning on/off the switches from
the other mbed board and vice versa.

Pls. check my google drive for pictures of the two mbed boards running this program.

I also tried installing the Windows driver for the MBED serial console so I can use pc.print and printf functions to display the
values of certain variables (using terminal program e.g. Hercules or hYperterminal) to help in the debugging.

I also tried monitoring the Tx and Rx pins using logic analyzer giving me some more information to better understand
asynchronous form of serial communication
