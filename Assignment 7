Answers:

I did checkout the elua.git
I concentrated my study on the elua shell. I downloaded the elua.bin and saved this to the MBED board.
I was then able to try out different commands in elua and also the lua. I used the Tera Term program as the terminal for elua in the windows environment.
Here are the elua commands that I tried:
help, ver, dir, ls, mkdir, lua,  cp, cat, and exit 
I also tried the following lua commands into my MBED board to trun on/off the MBED LED1.
led = mbed.pio.LED1
pio.pin.setdir(pio.OUTPUT, led)
pio.pin.sethigh(led)
tmr.delay(0, 500000) 
pio.pin.setlow(led)
tmr.delay(0, 500000)

I also tried printing “hello world” to display in the tera ware terminal.

I learned that the elua shell is a line interpreter and was able to display hello world, and turn on /off the LEDs in the
MBED board.
