Objective: Study elua development environment

Check out: https://github.com/Shengliang/elua.git

Please use gitk to review those change logs. 
  - apt-get install gitk

- a new shell command in elua shell.
- a new API that can be called from elua.

This script requires some well-known Lua libraries to run.
To install them on Ubuntu/Debian, go (as root):
apt-get install luarocks
luarocks install luafilesystem
luarocks install lpack
luarocks install md5
 
Then, type "./build.sh" to compile.

Study Notes:
How to create a cscope?
   find . -name "*.[chS]" > cscope.files
   vi cscope.files
   cscope

How to create & appy a git patch?
 git ls-remote https://github.com/shengliang/e4357.git 

# git: create a patch from top cl
   git show [hashID]
   git format-patch HEAD~

   # extract 2 topmost commits
   git format-patch -2

# apply a patch
   git am <...patch>

# add files
   git diff
   git status
   git add build.sh
   git add src/shell/shell_mem.c
   git commit -a -m 'shell: add md'
   git commit -a -m 'lua: add md'
   git commit -a --amend 

# checkin local branch to remote branches
   git remote -v
   git push origin local_branch_name:remote_branch_name
   git push origin master:master
   git push origin :remtoe_branch_name  //delete a remote branhc

# change remote url
   git remote set-url origin git://new.url.here
   git push origin master:master

Answers:

I did checkout the elua.git
I concentrated my study on the elua shell. I downloaded the elua.bin and saved this to the MBED board.
I was then able to try out different commands in elua and also the lua. I used the Tera Term program as the terminal for elua in the windows environment.
Here are the elua commands that I tried:
help, ver, dir, ls, mkdir, lua,  cp, cat, and exit 
I also tried the following lua commands into my MBED board to trun on/off the MBED LED1.
led = mbed.pio.LED1
pio.pin.setdir(pio.OUTPUT, led)
pio.pin.sethigh(led)
tmr.delay(0, 500000) 
pio.pin.setlow(led)
tmr.delay(0, 500000)


I also tried printing “hello world” by using this command:
eLua# lua -e 'print("Hello, World")' -i

I learned that elua (embedded lua) is a line interpreter and was able to the display hello world, and turn on /off the LEDs
in the MBED board. 

In trying to understand and familiarize myself to the lua development environment, I learned the following:
luarocks is a deployment & management system for Lua modules that allows installation of self-contained modules as
self-contained packages called “rocks”.
  
luafilsesystem is a Lua library developed to complement the set of functions related to file systems offered by the 
standard Lua distribution.

lpack is a lua library module to pack & unpack binary data.

md5 is a basic cryptographic facilities for Lua. It consists of a hash (digest) function, a pair of crypt/decrypt based on MD5, and CFB.
